Hey, this is just my comparison between 2 password manager application that I used

|| 1Password | Bitwarden |
|---|---|---|
| Price | $2.99/month annually | **Free. Premium for $10/year** |
| UI | **Modern** | Classic |
| UX | *For me, this is better* | |
| Rich icons | I don't know how to update, even there is a feature to turn on/off | **It seems update automatically** |
| Scan TOTP image | **Supported** | Not supported |
