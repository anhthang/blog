I wanted to share a quick comparison of two password managers I recently tested. After giving both a fair shot, I've decided to switch back to **1Password**â€”here's why:

| Feature                   | 1Password                                                                       | Bitwarden                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Price**                 | $2.99/month (billed annually)                                                   | **Free**, or $10/year for Premium |
| **User Interface (UI)**   | **Modern and polished**                                                         | Classic and functional            |
| **User Experience (UX)**  | _More intuitive for me_                                                         | Decent, but not my preference     |
| **Website Icons**         | Can be updated manually, but doesn't update automatically (which I wish it did) | **Updates automatically**         |
| **TOTP QR Code Scanning** | **Supported**                                                                   | Not supported                     |

While Bitwarden is an excellent free option, I found **1Password's modern design and smoother experience** a better fit for my needs. If you've used either of these, what's your take? ðŸš€
