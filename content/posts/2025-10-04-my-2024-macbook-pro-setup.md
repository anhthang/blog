The upgrade cycle is complete! I've gone from my trusty **2015 MacBook Pro** (retired at the end of 2021) and the M1 MacBook Air that bridged the gap, straight to the latest **2024 MacBook Pro**. This isn't just an upgrade; it's a quantum leap in performance, display quality, and efficiency.

I also refreshed my personal tech ecosystem with an **iPhone 17 Pro Max** and the discounted **AirPods Pro 3**.

Here's a quick look at what's new in my development setup.

### Migration and New Foundations

The biggest shift in my process this time was finally embracing **dotfiles**. Migrating from my Mac mini M1, I used this as the perfect opportunity to codify my environment. Now, setup is simply running a script—repeatable, consistent, and tracked via Git.

My core system tools remain stable and reliable:

- **Package Manager:** **Homebrew** is still essential for every app and utility.
- **Launcher**: **Raycast** is the must-have command bar and launcher that replaces Spotlight and much more. It's crucial for my keyboard-centric workflow.
- **Window Tiling Manager:** **Yabai** for macOS is non-negotiable for maximizing screen space.
- **Shell:** **Oh My Zsh** provides all the power and plugins I need for a productive terminal.

### New Tools: Speed and Style

The new machine is all about performance and a fresh aesthetic. I've made two key application swaps:

- **The New Terminal**: I finally switched from iTerm2 to **Ghostty**. It's a GPU-accelerated terminal that is ridiculously fast, offering the high-performance experience that pairs perfectly with the new Apple Silicon chip.

- **Aesthetic Shift**: I swapped my code editor and terminal theme from the **Dracula** to the beautiful and rich **Catppuccin**. Why? You know, _it's cat-themed_.

### The Browser Search Continues

This is the toughest part of the entire refresh. I loved **Arc**, but with its development pivoting and feeling largely abandoned (in favor of their new AI browser, Dia), I need a new daily driver.

What I miss most about Arc—and what I'm desperately looking for in an alternative—is the incredible efficiency of **Split View**, the **Command Palette** for fast navigation, and the **clean, bookmark-less window** provided by its vertical tabs.

My current list of candidates, who offer the core features I need, includes:

- **Zen:** A promising, open-source, Firefox-based project that features both vertical tabs and **Split View**.
- **SigmaOS:** Known for its Workspaces, Command Bar, and its own effective **Split Screen** capability.
- **Ora:** A newer, **WebKit-powered** browser for macOS that is explicitly inspired by both Safari and Arc, featuring a **Vertical Sidebar** and native **Split Tabs**.
- **Lia:** Another browser on the radar, built on Chromium with an Arc-style sidebar, and featuring a visually striking **Native Liquid Glass** style.

For now, I'm back on **Chrome**, but the search for a new, stable, and feature-rich home for my workflow is an ongoing mission. Any suggestions for the ultimate Arc replacement?
