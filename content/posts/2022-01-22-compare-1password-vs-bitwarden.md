I just wanted to share a quick comparison of two password managers I tried out. Ultimately, I'm switching back to 1Password.

These options offer a more engaging introduction and clarify your decision to return to 1Password.

|| 1Password | Bitwarden |
|---|---|---|
| Price | $2.99/month annually | **Free. Premium for $10/year** |
| UI | **Modern** | Classic |
| UX | *For me, this is better* | |
| Rich icons | I don't know how to update, even there is a feature to turn on/off | **It seems update automatically** |
| Scan TOTP image | **Supported** | Not supported |
